**#7** Import the members of the current US Congress Data using one programming language software and the data URL https://theunitedstates.io/congress-legislators/legislators-current.json. Now, print the structure of the data. **This structure should match the data description below. FYI, to import this dataset, you'll need a code chunk (RStudio) or code cell (Jupyter Lab).** For Python users, use the Box data URL https://uofi.box.com/shared/static/jr79doirqzea8nxoyq175unpoifwem1f.json.

The dataset (a .json file) contains the 538 members of the US Congress with 6 variables ("columns") per person which includes details about the legislators' first and last names, middle name, nickname, and suffixes. According to the GovTrack, "the United States Congress has two chambers, one called the Senate and the other called the House of Representatives (or "House" for short) which share the responsibilities of the legislative process to create federal statutory law." The original source is GovTrack.
