# Course Announcements

Posted 12-12-2021

Please see the final exam in the **exams** folder of the **stat440-fa21-course-content repo**. You may begin now. The strict deadline to submit the exam in your individual student repo (as both .Rmd/.ipynb and .html) is December 14, 2021 by 11:59 pm. If both files are not present in your repo by that time, then your exam grade will be a 0 for no submission. Work diligently. Use your time wisely. Commit your files to your repo often.

Good luck! It's been a good semester overall. I wish you all well in your future endeavors.

Sincerely,
Chris

If you have not completed the lab03, then you must come to class on Wednesday December 01, 2021. 

During Week 16 (the last week of the semester), I will critique and openly rant about these four articles - [Article01](https://www.albanyherald.com/news/albany-is-among-the-most-dangerous-us-metro-areas/article_16ac57e8-f910-55cf-a53c-25773f94b8bc.html), [Article02](https://www.indexjournal.com/florence-sc-is-among-the-most-dangerous-us-metro-areas/article_6cea8fb3-04ea-5e44-81c7-d2d0836f8550.html), [Article03](https://www.indexjournal.com/sumter-sc-is-among-the-most-dangerous-us-metro-areas/article_88385bce-170e-56c0-ae77-b4f94d9d8dc5.html), and [Article04](https://247wallst.com/special-report/2021/11/12/americas-most-dangerous-cities-2/) - written by a self-proclaimed data journalist. Read these articles prior to coming to class. If you want to come along for the ride, please come to class on Monday (December 06, 2021) and Wednesday (December 08, 2021) and bring your questions and critiques as well. Reading Day is Thursday December 09, 2021. There are no office hours on December 10, 2021.

## All Students - Homework04 Problem 10 Solutions Updated and Final Project Grades Updated

I recognize that in Problem 10, the delivery stores data was not required. Under that condition, the number of panelists would be 1329. Thus, I have credited students back 1 point if that was the reason they missed that problem.

Also, students who have completed the final project such that I approved their pull request, have been given 40 points for their final project grade. 

You will see the new grades reflected in your repo by this 5 pm this evening.

## GHE Data URLs Not Working for Python Users and Workaround

On September 30, 2021, Let's Encrypt (a service for SSL certificates in GitHub Enterprise changed the way they handle SSL certificates. That change has created problems for Python users and makes importing data using the typical tokenized URLs in this course return errors such as `URLError: <urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: certificate has expired (_ssl.c:1091)>`. 

The workaround is for me to provide data URLs from Box in addition to the data URLs from GHE for the remainder of the semester. The Box URLs do not require tokenization and thus are not temporary (unless the file is deleted in Box). You will see these changes in the current homework03 markdown file as well as old and future assignments.

Homework03 links have been updated. **If you're using Git or a Git client, then pull the stat440-fa21-course-content repo.**

I will announce when old assignments have the new Box data URLs by the weekend.

## Not-So-Gentle Reminder: Submit Two Files into Your Repo Per Assignment

For all remaining assignments (lab/challenge02-03, homework02-05, midterm exam, final exam), you must submit both files in order to be graded. Those two files are the reproducible file (either .Rmd or .ipynb) and .html file. Any student without both files submitted into their individual student repo by the assignment's deadline will be considered late. The course staff will follow the following policies for those assignments:

- for homework assignments, follow the late homework policy  
- for lab/challenge assignments, deduct 1 point for it being late  
- for midterm and final exams, it will not be graded at all; student earns a 0.

## All Students - Homework01-02 Solutions Posted

Please see homework solutions for the first two assignments in the **homework** folder within the stat440-fa21-course-content repo.

## Section 1UG/GR Only - Lab02 Starts Week07 (Next Week)

As a reminder, all Lab01 grades have been completed and should be in your individual student repos. 

The solutions of all versions of Lab01 are posted in the **labs** folder within the stat440-fa21-course-content repo.

Lab02 starts in Week07 and ends in Week10. Every Monday and Wednesday in October, all students in this section should come to class, because you never know which day you will be the driver. The drivers' names will be written on the boards in the classroom that refers to the specific station where the driver is expected to sit. When your name is not on the board, then you are the passenger. Any driver's lab assignment without actual in-person passengers will not be accepted or graded; meaning you cannot complete a lab as the driver by yourself without passengers. All students get 1 chance to be the driver.

Read them and follow them.

This exam's conceptual coverage, just like every assignment in this class, is cumulative. Study, look over previous assignments/solutions, and make sure you've practiced them by yourself.

## Section 1UG/GR Only - Explanation of Labs and Deadlines

It has come to my attention that some students are misunderstanding the lab assignments and their deadlines. Here's a clarification. On Mondays and Wednesdays, all students are expected to come to class. On those days, 10 students are selected at random to be the drivers, while other students will be passengers. There is one driver at each station. The drivers must submit the lab by the end of the class period. For each lab (lab01, lab02, lab03), every student in section 1UG/GR will get 1 chance to be a driver by the deadline. For example, for lab01, every student will get 1 chance to be the driver by (and including) Sept. 29, 2021. The deadlines for the labs are:

- Lab01 September 29, 2021 at 10:50 am  
- Lab02 October 27, 2021 at 10:50 am  
- Lab03 December 01, 2021 at 10:50 am  

## Section 0UG/GR Only - Challenge02 Posted

Please see the second challenge assignment within the **challenges** folder of the stat440-fa21-course-content repo. This challenge assignment has instructions within it, so do read them. You will submit challenge02 in your individual student repo by Wednesday October 13, 2021 at 11:59 pm.

The lab assignments will be used to assess students' (in section 1UG/GR) understanding of posted content.
