    "Welcome to STAT 440/CSE 440! These are the course notes which can be found in the **stat440-fa21-course-content** repository or in GitHub Enterprise. **GitHub Enterprise may be called GHE short.** **The images/screenshots in these notes may refer to Spring 2021, but ignore that. The information is the accurate for Fall 2021.** The intent of this course is to discuss and demonstrate typical data wrangling and data management tasks for students who are comfortable using R or Python. These notes are written ideally for the student who is unfamiliar with such tasks or who has not seen data wrangling tasks on real datasets. If you are a practicing data engineer, then these notes may not be useful. If you came to these notes looking for information about Python and Jupyter Lab, please view the file with the .ipynb extension in the **stat440-fa21-course-content** repository or [here](https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/stat440-fa21/stat440-fa21-course-content/blob/master/notes/stat440-fa21-notes-week01-intro-to-course-and-software-python.ipynb).\n",

    "**Python** is an open-source programming language gaining popularity for its adaptability for software development and other pipeline workflows. It is free to use and steadily improved by its users in statistics and data science. We can code in Python - usually in a **script** - and saved as a .py file. The output of the code we run is visible with an **interpreter** (usually in an integrated development environment) in a **console**.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Git** is a version control system and **GitHub Enterprise** (or GHE) is one platform for uniting git commands with a collaborative workflow. Git and GHE smooth collaboration by allowing multiple users to work on the same document on their own devices all at the same time. Then those users can submit their updates, describe their updates, and no one needs to rename the file. That file is updated in Git with the same file name it began with. Even if you are working alone on a code file, using version control can help alleviate confusion about what you were doing last time on that file. \n",
    "\n",
    "## <a name=\"git-and-github-enterprise\"></a>Git\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is the software that allows us to connect to repositories (or repos for short) and collaborate on projects that may exist in GHE. Git does not have an interface, as it is the version control software itself. Usually, we have an interface to use git. That interface can be your local machine's terminal or command prompt: 'Terminal' (macOS/linux) or 'Git Bash' (Windows). Another interface can be a git client such as RStudio or GitHub Desktop. I'll say more about these and how to setup your connection to your repo in the sections below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some Git terms (in alphabetical order) we need to become familiar with.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **branches**: pathways of the repo. We can work on branches without affecting the master and this may be useful for experimenting with something without affecting the main project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **cloning**: copying an existing repo so that it can be accessed remotely on your local machine\n",
    "\n",
    "- **commit**: a snapshot of the last saved version of a file and the corresponding message explaining what changed in this version of the file\n",
    "\n",
    "- **diff**: the set of differences between commits; observing diffs helps keep track of what has changed across two commits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **directory**: a folder or sub-folder within a repository\n",
    "\n",
    "- **fetching**: downloading files (from a remote) that are not in your working directory\n",
    "\n",
    "- **history**: the tracking of all changes to a file\n",
    "\n",
    "- **master**: the main track of your repo. The master is also considered a branch. **GHE may eventually replace the name \"master\" with a new name due to social justice advocates who oppose the oppressive history of the term \"master\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **merge conflict**: when two separate branches have made edits to the same line in a file, or when a file has been deleted in one branch but edited in the other. Merge conflicts can be fixed by manually editing the problem file and then merging and re-committing/pushing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **merging**: combines updated information into one single file and puts that on the master. Merging may be used to resolve conflicts when collaborators commit changes on the same file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **pulling**: a single command that does both fetching and merging\n",
    "\n",
    "- **pushing**: finalizing and formalizing an updated file by adding the changes from your local working directory to GHE\n",
    "\n",
    "- **remote**: the cloned repo\n",
    "\n",
    "- **repo (or repository)**: the main folder or space in which a project exists\n",
    "\n",
    "- **staging (or the staging area)**: a file that stores information about what's being committed. We want to stage a file after we've updated it in some way so that it can be committed\n",
    "\n",
    "## <a name=\"git-and-github-enterprise\"></a>GitHub Enterprise\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we are using **GitHub Enterprise**, which we call \"GHE\" for simplicity, as an LMS and as a tool for self-collaboration. **LMS means that GHE will function as the main course space - students will retrieve assignments, submit their assignments in their individual student repos, see their grades, get course updates and announcements, communicate with each other and with the course staff, access necessary course content, etc. Here self-collaboration means that you will work on a file, such as a homework assignment, and make several commits for that file as you complete the problems. Each time you make a commit, it is best to push the file to your individual student repo to submit it. Thus, your file versions are only collaborated between you and yourself.** The course exists in GHE at the website https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/stat440-fa21/stat440-fa21-course-content. The course website landing page is the README.md file, which will serve as the Course Announcements. You should check the course website frequently for updates and course announcements. Also, as the syllabus mentions, one of the main ways to communicate is in the Issues board, which functions as a discussion board much like Piazza. To access the Issues board, go to the course landing page and click on the Issues tab. \n",

    "1. Using GHE\n",
    "2. Using Git from the command line\n",
    "3. Using Git with RStudio\n",

    "All three will get you the access to course content and for assignment retrieval and submission. But only the first way (Using GHE) will allow you to use the Issues board for posting questions and seeing responses. The second and third ways still require some aspect of the first way because of GHE. Below I discuss the procedures for setting up and connecting your individual student repo to your local machine as well as how to submit a **homework00** file in each of the three ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to complete these procedures successfully, you must first do these two steps:\n",
