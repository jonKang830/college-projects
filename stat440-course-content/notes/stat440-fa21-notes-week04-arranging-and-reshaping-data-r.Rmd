## <a name="arranging-data"></a>Arranging data

Arranging a dataset involves organizing its columns and sorting the data by one or more of its columns. 

### <a name="organizing"></a>Organizing columns

By organizing the data we may want certain columns to appear as the first column, second column, etc. See edited image taken from [RStudio's dplyr cheat sheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)

Using the tidyverse, organizing the columns can be accomplished with the `select()` function which is within the **dplyr** package. Recall the City of Urbana's [Rental Inspection Grades Listing Data as tab-separated .txt](https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/stat440-fa21/stat440-fa21-course-content/raw/master/data/rental-inspections-grades-data03.txt). 

```{r notesweek04_01}
library(tidyverse)

RentalsData <- read_delim("https://raw.github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/stat440-fa21/stat440-fa21-course-content/master/data/rental-inspections-grades-data03.txt?token=AAABJGYPNPRLJDH2JQESWD3BGO3FG", delim="\t")

head(RentalsData)
```

Let's arrange the Rental Inspection Grades Listing Data such that:

- the first column is Parcel Number  
- the second column is Property Address  
- the third column is Mappable Address  
- the fourth column is Inspection Date  
- the fifth column is Expiration Date  
- the sixth column is License Status
- the seventh column is Grade  

```{r notesweek04_02}
RentalsData %>% 
  select(`Parcel Number`, `Property Address`, `Mappable Address`, `Inspection Date`, `Expiration Date`, `License Status`, Grade) %>%
  head(., 5)

RentalsData2 <- RentalsData %>% 
  select(`Parcel Number`, `Property Address`, `Mappable Address`, `Inspection Date`, `Expiration Date`, `License Status`, Grade)

head(RentalsData2, 5)
```

***SN: The pipe operator `%>%` comes with the tidyverse package and is a neat way to complete multiple lines of code and nesting of functions without doing all that. It takes the first code on the left side of the first pipe operator and places it into a pipeline of operations. Our code above can be translated in laypeople's terms as "beginning with `RentalsData` and then select these columns and then show the first 5 rows of the result.***

Also, notice that in order to store the newly arranged data, we need to assign the data with the assignment operator.

### <a name="sorting"></a>Sorting columns

Sorting the data by the values in the columns involves the tidyverse's `arrange()` function (**dplyr** package). Now let's sort the data such that the Parcel Numbers are in ascending order showing the resulting first 10 rows.

```{r notesweek04_03}
RentalsData2 %>% 
  arrange(`Parcel Number`) %>%
  head(., 10)
```

We can complicate this arrangement by specifying the sort order of more columns. Let's sort the Rental Inspection Grades Listing Data such that the Grades in descending order then Parcel Numbers are in ascending order and showing the resulting first 10 rows. 

```{r notesweek04_04}
RentalsData2 %>% 
  arrange(desc(Grade), `Parcel Number`) %>%
  head(., 10)
```

## <a name="reshaping-data"></a>Reshaping data
Reshaping a dataset can be a good way to ensure the information we want is in the proper orientation. Two actions usually encompass reshaping: pivoting and transposing. The particular action being taken ultimately depends on the scenario. 

## <a name="pivoting"></a>Pivoting

Pivoting may happen in two ways: 

1. "lengthening", which makes the dataset longer (more rows than we started). See image taken from [RStudio's dplyr cheat sheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf). 

![](https://uofi.box.com/shared/static/o5h7rqsgy9xcy23m8uq0wup8b6vglgxn.png)

2. "widening", which makes the dataset wider (more columns than we started). See image taken from [RStudio's dplyr cheat sheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)

![](https://uofi.box.com/shared/static/2pl1dlbmjdqhri43zvrsov2emlkuogf4.png)

To prepare the data for pivoting, we are adding two columns to the City of Urbana's [Rental Inspection Grades Listing Data as tab-separated .txt](https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/stat440-fa21/stat440-fa21-course-content/raw/master/data/rental-inspections-grades-data03.txt) (named object `RentalsData`). *Pivoting may not be necessary with the original `RentalsData`.*

```{r notesweek04_05}
Coordinates<-str_split(RentalsData$`Mappable Address`, "\\\n", simplify = TRUE)[,3]
Coordinates00 <- str_remove_all(Coordinates, "\\)|\\,|\\(")
Coordinates000 <- str_split(Coordinates00, " ", simplify = TRUE)
RentalsData$Coordinates01 <- Coordinates000[,1]
RentalsData$Coordinates02 <- Coordinates000[,2]
```

With this new version of the City of Urbana's Rental Inspection Grades Listing Data, suppose that we wanted the decimal values in columns Coordinates01 and Coordinates02 in a single column. To accomplish this, we can use the `pivot_longer()` function (within the **tidyverse**; **tidyr**) since would be making the data longer; we're adding more rows than there were originally.

```{r notesweek04_06}
RentalsData3 <- RentalsData %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=c(Coordinates01,Coordinates02), names_to="Coordinate", values_to="Decimal" )

head(RentalsData3)
```

That's it! We just increased the number of rows of `RentalsData` to 3460.

Now, with this newly pivoted data, let's demonstrate "widening" the data. In this way, we want to increase the number of columns; essentially reverting back to the version of the data before "lengthening." *Notice that we first use the `arrange()` function to sort the Coordinate column.*

```{r notesweek04_07}
RentalsData4 <- RentalsData3 %>% 
  arrange(Coordinate) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Coordinate, values_from = Decimal)

head(RentalsData4)
```

Done! Technically the number of columns did not increase, but the number of rows did decrease. This is another way to know that the "widening" worked appropriately.

## <a name="transposing"></a>Transposing

When it comes to transposing, all we're accomplishing is making the columns become the rows, alternating the dimension of the data: formerly row## by column## to presently column## by row##.

```{r notesweek04_08}
RentalsData5 <- t(RentalsData)

dim(RentalsData)
dim(RentalsData5)
```

We see the data went from 1730 by 9 to presently 9 by 1730.
