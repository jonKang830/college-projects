    "\n",
    "Validation means the checking of something for its accuracy. Validating data means checking a dataset for invalid or inaccurate entries. This kind of checking is important because as data workers we do not want analyses to start with bad or incorrect data. The first step consists of defining errors. Data errors or data glitches are those data entries that should not be there and may be caused by human error or machine error. Maybe not always, but often these errors are fixable with enough context and background information about the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common data errors include:\n",
    "\n",
    " - duplicate observations (rows)\n",
    "\n",
    " - lack of correspondence across fields (columns)\n",
    "\n",
    " - inconsistent measurements and/or units\n",
    "\n",
    " - values that are beyond outliers\n",
    "\n",
    " - variable formatting (e.g. date, numeric vs character)\n",
    "\n",
    " - misspelled words and nonstandard abbreviations\n",
    "\n",
    " - a patterned inaccuracy affecting a large number of records\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section of the notes, we will utilize data validation strategies that could help us identify data errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a name=\"stra1\"></a>Strategy 1 - Filtering and arranging\n",
    "\n",
    "We can view a print out of a subset based on specific conditions to identify values that either go against or with the conditions. Arranging may help organize the values to quickly assess start or end points. Do review arranging data (Week 04 notes) and data reduction (Week 05 notes) and pay special attention to how to implement regular expressions in your preferred programming language (Week 07 notes). **There are alternatives to using regular expressions to deal with character strings. Just as there are coding alternatives to achieve most results for this course. Students must do what they are comfortable with so long as it is in alignment with an assignment's instructions.**\n",

    "Working with the City of Urbana's [Rental Inspection Grades Listing Data as comma-separated .csv - GHE](https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/stat440-fa21/stat440-fa21-course-content/raw/master/data/rental-inspections-grades-data01.csv) or [Rental Inspection Grades Listing Data as comma-separated .csv - Box](https://uofi.box.com/shared/static/l9o50efbnemdnaxury4hg45cj8b2truu.csv), we can validate that there is a small number of properties earning an inspection grade of A since year 2019. \n"

    "We can create a frequency table of a select number of variables. Since it's a frequency table, it has potential to be cross-classified by design. Ideally, the variables for which we want to know the frequency should be grouping or categorical variables. Frequency tables also aid in determining the number of distinct (or unique) values. It is common for a statistical dataset to contain an ID variable - one that uniquely identifies each observation (e.g. UIN, Social Security Number, 10 digit phone number). However, when that is not the case, figuring out which variable to trust as an ID variable can be difficult especially when attempting to discover duplicate observations. An idea may be to combine two or more variables (through concatenation) to create a new ID variable.\n",

    "Although not a focus of our course, producing data visualizations of the distributions of certain variables would allow for a quick inspection of \"reasonableness\" of the values. For a numeric variable, we can use histograms to show shape and possible skewness and box plots to show symmetry (above and below the median) and potential outliers (1.5\\*IQR Rule aka \"Box Plot Rule\"). For a categorical variable, we can use bar plots for a nicer visual than a frequency table.\n",

    "\n",
    "You need to know context and background information about the data to truly fix data errors. Guessing is not appropriate, especially when money or lives are at stake. Data cleaning is a data-specific task that can be tedious and painful. Do expect to spend a long time (your allotted time multiplied by 2) on data validating and cleaning. Careful and methodical fixing of errors may yield wondrous results for your analytics team (but don't spend too much time!).\n",

    "Some common data cleaning approaches include:  \n",
    "\n",
    " - removing duplicate observations  \n",
    " \n",
    " - fixing rounding errors and inconsistent units of measurement\n",
    " \n",
    " - removing or replacing missing values\n",
    " \n",
    " - limiting a distribution to its realistic set of observations\n",
    " \n",
    " - correcting and subsetting with dates\n",
    " \n",
    " - correcting misspelled words, abbreviations, or text cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a name=\"appr1\"></a>Approach 1 - Removing duplicate observations\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing duplicates when the observation's duplication add no new information is helpful in data cleaning. We exercise precaution when removing observations by not removing anything from permanent data files. Use a renamed version or copy of the data in your programming language; always keep the original as the original. Creating a counter variable might be helpful to identify non-unique observations for removal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing observations can be accomplished via **filtering.** For example, if we were to remove incorrect coordinate values. **This is not something we should do for this particular dataset.**"

    "### <a name=\"appr2\"></a>Approach 2 - Fixing rounding errors and inconsistent units of measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric inconsistencies can plague data analysis. Fixing them can be as simple as converting the existing variable to another more accessible unit of measure (e.g. centimeters instead of inches). Re-formatting the variable may solve other numeric errors, especially when the numeric value we want is initially treated as a character string. Rounding errors may be fixed quickly by employing a function in the programming language such as ceiling, flooring, and rounding. \n",

    "We could round the latitude and longitude values of `rentals` data to the hundredths place via rounding."

    "\n",
    "With unstructured text data, correcting spellings comes up often. When it is important that words should be spelled correctly, a data engineer can spend time addressing it. However, it may be untenable to attempt to correctly spell each word in a text dataset. (Also, the text source's intent should be considered, such as African American Vernacular English, and other vernaculars that appear in writing). Another aspect of text data cleaning is deciding what to do with the case of the words in the text. Processing text might go smoother if we lower (or upper) the case on all text. For specific variables in a structured dataset, changing the case to a proper case might be beneficial (e.g. people's name, business name).\n",
