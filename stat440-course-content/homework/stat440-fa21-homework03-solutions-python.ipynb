It is always recommended that you **pull** (or refresh) the **stat440-fa21-course-content** repo to ensure that you have the most updated version of all course content including the homework assignments. After pulling (or refreshing) the **stat440-fa21-course-content** repo, the homework file will be in the homework directory.

The individuals are not identifiable based on personal identity, but they are given unique jacket numbers. Some rows in the data appear more than once because of multiple crimes being assigned to one person. But there is also the possibility of there being recidivists. A recidivist is a person who goes to jail repeatedly (more than one datetime). The demographics of the people, reasons for being booked, and crime code are also given in the data.
