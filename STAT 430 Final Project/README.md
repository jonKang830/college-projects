## Abstract  

The objective of this project is to investigate criminal activity within Chicago. This involves analyzing timely trends and geographical locations for crimes since the year of 2019. Through our models, we aim to get an insight into estimating the likelihood of criminal activity, and by using that, people can make better-influenced decisions on where and when we should avoid certain locations around Chicago. We will use a decision tree model to predict the type of criminal activity based on time and geographical descriptions and use time series to forecast future criminal activity counts. Moreover, we will also use clustering algorithms and attempt to identify locations with the most violent cases.
